Potential mechanics:
Tutorial via texting
Tone mechanic where you have to guess the tone that person is talking in. 
Optional VA
Words you hear or say are echoed visually in the subtitles and in the audio.
In order to keep focus during a conversation, the player must continuously use the scroll wheel while someone else is talking, or else the text and audio will begin to 
distort and blur.
There will be a generic dialogue option to laugh and say something like, "That's very interesting." in case you can't think of a good way to respond or you missed what 
the other person said.
When the date mentions an interest they have that you might share, there is a risk that you could fall down a rabbit hole of only having dialogue options gushing about
that interest.
Randomly distort the name of the date every so often
Characters are faceless and mannequin-like to show that you have trouble 
Character creation where you input data on yourself and that modifies how the date treats you

Devlopment:
Write each line with a defined tone.
