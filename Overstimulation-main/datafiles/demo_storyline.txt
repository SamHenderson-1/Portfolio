Options:
1, You: "I mean, you are kind of haggard, and you definitely drink like an old sailor..."
Him: "Haah, So I'm a pirate now? I kind of like that image... It's quite fitting for my acquired taste and rugged physique. Thanks for the compliment."
2, You: "I mean it's not really like either of you should be bragging about all that anyways. People aren't just objects in your little games, you know."
Him: "....oh. No need to be so serious man, I was just pulling your leg."
3, You: "I don't feel like I pulled anything. My legs are fine."
Him: "Oh... That's good...? I feel like I'm missing a joke here..."
4, You: "I mean..."
Him: "...Well your silence speaks volumes, I'm clearly right."
Waitress: "Ugh, y'know you could stand to lose some of that cockiness, hun. It'd serve you well when talking to a lady, that's for sure..."
Him: "Haah, it was always like you to undermine my greatest features... Well, I'm sure you've got other customers to bother, don't-cha? It was nice introducing you two though."
Waitress: "Well take care now you... I'm serious about that! No more late nights, and don't drink yourself into a coma. I don't want to see it on our tab here."
Him: "Okay... I won't, I promise. I'm 30 somethin' now y'know, don't go treating me like a kid.
Anyways, how'd you like my ride tonight? It's the oldest model, a Red Cadillac in pretty good condition if you ask me."
Options:
1, You: "Yeah, the leather seats were comfy. Surprisingly no stains either."
Him: "You think? I got them custom made with a revamped A/C system and a killer speaker set just for nights like these. Installed new headlights because the old ones were tacky, but I like older stuff."


2, You: "The... convertible? Yeah it was nice, I always wanted one myself."
Him: "Huh? What do you mean â€˜convertible'? Okay, there are some great convertible models out there, but this is not one of them. Could you not tell? Thought you had some taste..."
3, You: "I mean something like that hasn't happened yet..."
