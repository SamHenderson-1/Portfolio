[FADE_FILL(), MUSIC_STOP]I[SET_SPEED(1)]t's been a while since you've been on a date.

In fact, you can't remember the last time you went on one.

You met this guy on some dating app though, and things went okay. 

You were kind of unsure at first if signing up for it was a good idea in the first place...

But after talking to a few guys on there, one stuck with you. 

He seemed like an outgoing guy from his profile pictures, so you talked for a minute.

This man was a little verbose, though at times it seemed a little cheesy and thoughtless. 

Nonetheless, you agreed to meet up with him after a few days of texting back and forth.

He, of course, picked out the shadiest looking dive bar you'd ever seen when you looked it up.

He insisted that the reviews were written by drunks who got kicked out of the bar. 

You had kind of a hard time believing him on that one, but at least it would be a fun time, right?

Suppose the only thing you could do was find out. The spice of life was trying after all.

He picked you up that night in a fancy looking car. You could have sworn you recognized the model...

The seats were clearly custom made, and the overhead of the car was fixed in place nicely.

You two drove down the street, making slightly awkward small talk as you went. 

As unbearable as these moments tend to be, at least you got a sense of what he's like before the date. 

He insisted on keeping the windows halfway down, even though the sound kind of bothered you.

Something about the wind feeling good against his face. Can't argue with that I guess. 

Walking into the bar, the lights are low in the evening slump as few customers line the empty stalls and stools. 

You both find a booth sitting down in the slightly cushy seats as you take a look at the menus.

Some odd orders here, but a plentiful assortment of appetizers. It'll do for a quick grub.

Looking up at the date, he's beaming with the social poise of a local. 

You even saw him greet the few remaining customers and staff beforehand. 

He's been here many times. You can just tell.[SET_SPEED(0), FADE_IN_BLOCK(), MUSIC_START()]

Him: "[DATE_JUMP]So isn't it just the best here? [DATE_JUMP]Y'know, I always come to this place with people I really like."

Him: "[SET_SPEED(0)]Hey. So, it's almost time to go, but I got a question for ya before we leave."
Him: "How do you feel about me? Honestly? 
Him: "I can't really get a read on what you're thinking about right now, but what I can do is ask you."
Him: "I'm a pretty... Lonely person. I guess I've been on lots of dates, but all to no avail."
Him: "Normally, I get a pretty good grip on how someone's feeling by the end of a date, but I just can't seem to pin you down."

You have one new voicemail from: Him
Him: "Hey, it's me.."
Him: "[SET_SPEED(0)] Thanks for everything by the way, you were great company last night, y'know."
Him: "I guess it's kinda weird to ask so soon, but do you wanna hang out again?"
Him: "I mean, you're my type of guy. Maybe we can work something out together."
Him: "I'll warn ya though, I'm pretty unstable..."
Him: "But it's been a while since I've met a guy like you. You're... different somehow."
Him: "I know I come off as a bit of a jerk, but I promise I'll take good care of ya if you let me."
Him: "Well let me know, I'll be around next Tuesday if you're down to come to my place then."

You have one new voicemail from: Him
Him: "[SET_SPEED(0)]...Alright. Clearly, something's up with you. Why were you acting like you were irritated by me last night?"
Him: "It's clear by what you've said that you don't care, so why bother?!"
Him: "You want me to get better, but I can't see how your advice holds any weight when you act like that on a first date."
Him: "Y'know what? I'm done with this. I pay for your food, and you're rude the whole time. Really?"
Him: "Do you know how much that cost me?! What a waste."
Him: "My patience has worn thin, and I'm not gonna take it from some brat who's livin' in some high-class apartment uptown."
Him: "Get lost! Lose my number, I'm finished with you! You hear me, don't call back ya snarky loser!"

You have one new voicemail from: Him
Him: "[SET_SPEED(0)]Man, that was... Thanks for the date, I guess?"
Him: "You're a funny guy, that's for sure."
Him: "Haah, loved all the jokes." 
Him: "Not a lot of guys have such a... unique sense of humor."
Him: "..."
Him: "I- uh... I'll call you."

...
No new messages show up on your phone from the date. 
Seems like he lost interest in you after all. 
Maybe it was a good thing, maybe not. 
It still kind of bothered you that you didnt know exactly why he started ghosting you afterwards.
If he had a problem, why couldn't he have just brought it up?
Didn't you at least deserve a second chance?
...Whatever. Time to find another guy on that dating app and try again. Or maybe not. 
Love felt so far out of your grasp, might as well just give it up.
