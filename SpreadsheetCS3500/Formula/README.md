# Comments to Evaluators:

This assignment's code is far more complex than I thought it would be. I have unfortunately been 
unable to pass all of the grading tests for the FormulaEvaluator, so my implementation likely still 
has issues to patch out. The helper methods utilized here are incredibly plentiful and utilized 
frequently. I have also stopped formatting as much for now when it comes to the curly brackets as it 
has proven to be a waste of time.
