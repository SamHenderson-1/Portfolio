# Comments to Evaluators:

This is, by far, the largest tester class I have ever made at 1000 lines of code, with multiple 
stress tests and conditionals. The tester takes a reported 2-4 seconds to run simply due to many
of the stress test's purposes being to handle large amounts of info in an exhaustive way. Despite 
the many tests that are present, I do expect to return to this assingment at some point in the 
future for further polish. There are never enough tests.
