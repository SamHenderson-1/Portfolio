# Comments to Evaluators:
The code I have written is quite well optimized and tested; however, there is still room for 
improvement. For example, when writing this, I have not yet tested for multiple variables with 
unique values. Also, although I’m sure we will implement complex operations into the code later, 
there is no modulus case, root case, power case, etc.; basically, the Evaluator only solves early 
elementary-level equations. However, I have taken a lot of time to overhaul my assignment from 
previous commits to introduce many helper methods to make Evaluate() clean and easily readable. As a 
result, inline comments are infrequent. Still, when present, they are descriptive. Even then, thanks 
to helper methods, the code is self-explanatory and does an excellent job mirroring the original 
algorithm presented on the canvas assignment page. Almost all argument exceptions are unique so that 
if any issue does occur, the problem is more than easily identified. I created this code from scratch 
and with little to no outside help, with the only exceptions being quick questions to classmates on 
the format of testing for delegate variables and the assistance of the TAs.
