# Comments to Evaluators:
Please view the GUI's About Me Menu Item to gain a full comprehension of the program and it's capabilities. This 
assignment, as the lid to the last five assignments has been a massive endeavor. Josh and I knew that this would 
take plenty of time to implement, hence our estimate of 15 hours. However, we easily spent an extra three for 
polish and reworks. One of the biggest time drains has been our implementation of threads. With the failure of 
background worker, we decided to instead work with simple threading. Our differing work schedules also made it 
harder for us to meet up and go over code. Thankfully, the time we spent was well worth it and the Spreadsheet
works like a charm. Despite us being relatively far from our original time estimate, we still spent a good amount 
of time on additional features, such as the ability to change the theme of the spreadsheet aesthetics and the 
implementation of key presses.

Best (Team) Practices:
What worked -- We were very successful at utilizing git and overall version control to our advantage. Unfortunately, 
we did not get as much paired programming time as we initially thought we would. That being said we were able to use git versioning
along with the project board within GitHub to keep ourselves on task and could make visual progress. Assigning tasks and 
providing a thorough TODO list helped us organize what we needed to get done, who was going to do it, and when it was done. 

What needed improvement -- Our schedule did not line up as well as we had originally thought and so we were not able to code 
side-by-side as much as we had wanted. We did not communicate well during the first week of the assignment. Luckily, we got better 
as time went on. The GitHub project board definitely helped with our communication. Good communication from the start will 
be ideal for future projects.

# Branching
We had two branches, JoshBranch1 and SamBranch1, which we respectively worked on and experimented with. We would 
only merge the branch with our master after an intensive code review period with each other, which helped lead 
to a plethora of commits, each with a substantial amount of content.

However, that is not to say we had an easy time merging. Due to the differences in our branches, whenever we 
attempted to merge with the master, we would often have to manually ensure merge conflicts multiple times to avoid
critical build errors. Even after this there were often issues we then had to fix after the fact so that it was 
working properly.
